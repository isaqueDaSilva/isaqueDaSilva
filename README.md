# Hi there and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque and I'm 18 years old. I am passionate about technology and everything that involves it. Programming with Swift is what excites me most, as it is a language that has strong readability due to its simplicity of writing, but offers tremendous power to any application we can develop using it. I recently graduated from the 100 Days of SwiftUI marathon, where I learned a lot about iOS development, with Swift and SwiftUI, but I don't intend to stop here, and my next goal to achieve is to study Computer Science.
