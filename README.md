## ✨ About Me
Hello! I'm Isaque Machado, a software developer passionate about creating application-based solutions that solve problems and make a difference in the daily lives of those who use them.

I'm passionate about mathematics and physics, and that's why I always like to incorporate them, whether to use them myself or to base my work on their models, in order to propose something solid and mature enough for its full usefulness in the solution.

Furthermore, I like to always stay updated and informed about new techniques and concepts, with the aim of learning, experimenting, and applying them to my projects.
