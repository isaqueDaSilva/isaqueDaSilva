# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque, I'm 19 years old and I'm passionate about technology and everything that involves it, especially App Development.

I'm currently actively working on an update for my iOS Project that's I builded in 100 Days os SwiftUI, called Hot Prospect. Hot Prospect is an App to helps users to track who his meet at conferences. Originaly, this project used a thrird-party code for QR Code Scanner, and now, I'm make my own, and aditionally I'm build a custom API using Vapor Framework, for suports Logins, and notify users when a new user connect with you using a QR Code.
To see more about the project, visit the [Hot Prospect repository](https://github.com/isaqueDaSilva/HotProspects).
**Things that I do in my daily life:**
* Programming and creating amazing natively iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI.
* Keep on learning new things.
