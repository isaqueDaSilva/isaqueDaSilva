# Hi there and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque and I am 18 years old. I'm passionate about technology and everything that involves it, especially programming with Swift, which over time has become my favorite language, due to its simplicity and its power to create an application. I recently graduated from the 100 Days of SwiftUI marathon, where I developed a lot in iOS development, with Swift and SwiftUI, but I don't intend to stop here, and my next goal to achieve is to study Computer Science.
