# Hey everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque, I'm 19 years old and I'm passionate about technology and everything that involves it, especially App Development, which I believe that's the mainstream for enriches and simplify people's lives.

My main skill is in development of Apps for iOS platform using Swift and SwiftUI, where I have many projects finished with succeed, and others thatâ€™s coming soon. One of this projects, that I want to talk is the [Cupcake Corner](https://github.com/isaqueDaSilva/CupcakeCorner), thatâ€™s by far my most complex and ambitious app that I build until now, and I'm very proud to have built it, because I was capable to learn and put several things inside it that's turn fundamental for any app today, like RESTful API integration, Real-Time data, User Authentication and more.

Further, I am also focusing on adding even more knowledge to my skills list, like Machine Learning and AI, where I have plans to integrate some amazing features into my future public app.

# Things that I do in my daily life
* Creating and maintain natively iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI;
* Machine Learning and AI;
