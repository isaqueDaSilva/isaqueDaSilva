# Hi there and welcome to my profile ðŸ‘‹

## About me:

My name is Isaque, and I'm 18 years old. I'm currently studying iOS Development through 100 Days of Swift at Hacking with Swift. I intend to enroll in the Computer Science course next year. I'm passionate about technology and I love to learn new things, in addition to everything I do I put the maximum of my effort.
