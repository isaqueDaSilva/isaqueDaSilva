# Hey everybody ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque, I'm 19 years and I'm iOS developer with a passion for creating intuitive and easy-use app experiences. My expertise lies in iOS app development using Swift and SwiftUI. Even further, I have a solid understanding of key iOS frameworks and techniques such as Core Data, SwiftData, XCTest, RESTful API integration, MVVM design pattern and more.

I'm currently spend my time to improviment my knowledge, by learning and building personal projects, like the [Cupcake Corner](https://github.com/isaqueDaSilva/CupcakeCorner), that's one of my recent projects that I put a lot of those knowledges, like RESTful API integration, real-time data processing, user authentication and more in practice.

My goal as an iOS developer is to create apps that not only enrich peopleâ€™s lives but also have the potential to change the world. Iâ€™m driven by the challenge of bringing innovative ideas to life and constantly strive to push the boundaries of whatâ€™s possible.

# Things that I do in my daily life
* Learning best practices of iOS development;
* Improvement myself into app development process;
* Putting my new knowledge into practice;
