# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Isaque, I'm 19 years old and I'm passionate about technology and everything that involves it, especially App Development.

I'm currently actively working on a personal project called Cupcake Corner. This is an App that simulates a delivery app, where the user is shown a menu of Cupcakes available for ordering, and from there the user can place their orders. It is built entirely using Swift and SwiftUI, with integration into a custom RESTful API, which provides us with several features like the updated Menu, sends a notification to the admins when the user makes an order, or noticates the users when the order is ready, and alloways the user authentication in the system.

To see more about the project, visit the [Cupcake Corner repository.](https://github.com/isaqueDaSilva/CupcakeCorner)

# Things that I do in my daily life
* Programming and creating amazing natively iOS apps with Swift and SwiftUI.
* Keep on learning new things.
